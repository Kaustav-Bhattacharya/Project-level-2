## Lessons Learned

 With this project I learned to use
mediaquery in order to make the website responsive. To make a website responsive is no 
more an extra feature offered by that website , rather it is a necessity
thus to learn how to make a website mobile browser friendly first 
is the first thing that should cross one's mind 
and will cross mine too from now on as I've learned how to do it.
And am hopefull to learn more new things.
